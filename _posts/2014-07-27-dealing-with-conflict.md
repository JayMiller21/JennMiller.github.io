At the heart of preventing and mediating conflict is communitcation. I learned the hard way that this applies in the workplace as much as anywhere else.

It's been almost two months since I quit my engineering consulting job to pursue a career in computer programming. The path change was a result of a lack of engagement in my previous field. In each of my last two jobs, I became pretty unhappy before quitting. But I handled the situation better the second time around.

At my first job, I wasn't comfortable with some aspects of how my division operated. I realized around the 1 year mark that I was too unhappy to stay in my postion. There was another division I thought I might like to work in, but I didn't consider it as a possibility because I assumed I didn't have enough of the right skills. One of the partners approached me after he heard I was leaving the company. He wanted to know why I hadn't asked to work in the other division - He would have been happy to have me do so, he said. 

This being my first full time job, I had a number of misconceptions about the workplace. I felt it would be risky to express my discontentment because somehow, I might be asked to leave.

At this point in my life, I'd also never been taught the importance of communication - Not in school, not at home, and certainly not in my workplace. This incident was an important lesson. And fortunately, I've also come to understand the importance of communication through my personal relationships in the past few years. These are skills I'm always working to improve.

After leaving that job, I moved on to my most recent job, in which I also soon became unhappy. Here, it was because the work was not sufficiently challenging to engage me. This caused me to perform suboptimally. I have high standards for myself, and I thought - this is easy work - why am I not doing better? Of course, I received glowing preformance reviews - but I knew I could do so much more.

I knew after what happened at my last job that I needed to be forward about how unsatisfied I was feeling in my role. I told my boss that I was pretty unhappy and that I wanted more responsibility. I struck a good balance between being forward and honest, while being respectful. The following week, my boss gave two projects (albiet smaller ones) to manage. This was exciting at the time. But before too long, I was bored again. I told my boss as much, and he explained that it takes time to earn more responsibility - I still had a lot to learn.

At this point, I was realizing that this just wasn't the field for me right now. The slow pace of the industry was not a good fit for my thinking style. I'd given this industry a real shot - 3 years of exploration. I knew it was time to move on.

I learned in my first job that I wouldn't get what I wanted if I didn't ask. I learned in my second job that asking didn't guarantee results. But it was my decision to communicate openly that helped me get the most I could out of my job, and ultimately see that that wasn't enough for me. Acting as timely as I did meant that I could get started on this exciting new path all that much sooner.
