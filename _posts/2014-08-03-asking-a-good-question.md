Asking a good question is all about expressing the following as precisely and succinctly as possible:
- What you want - What is your desired outcome?
- What you've tried - List the attempts you made, including code where relevant.
- What you've gotten - What results did your attempts return? How are these different than your desired result?

Precision is important because it prevents a person answering your question from repeating what you've already tried. Succinctness is important because it will help someone understand your question more quickly and easily, making them more willing and able to help.

### A Not-So-Good Question ###

The following question leaves something to be desired by a potential responder:

(Find the original post <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25030544/ruby-methods-and-method-calls">here</a>).

#### The Bad ####

1. Title: The title gives a broad idea of the topic, but no specifics. A good title would reveal enough about the problem to indicate to readers with high certainty whether this may be in their scope of knowledge. A good title could be "'unexpected end' error when running Ruby methods and method calls."

2. Full error message not included: Ruby error messages indicate the line where an error was thrown, and the line of source code at which is responsible. This user does not provide this information, which could be helpful, particularly in a more complex problem.

3. Excessive code included: The greeter method code could have been omitted because it does not pertain to the error. Again, this is a pretty simple problem, but on more complex problems, it would be even more important to omit unnecessary information.


#### The Good ####

1. An appropriate tag is included.

2. Relevant code is included.


### A Better Question ###

The following question does a little better at presenting the problem information:

(Find the original post <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1609637/is-it-possible-to-insert-multiple-rows-at-a-time-in-an-sqlite-database">here</a>).

#### The Good ####

1. Title: The title says almost exactly what the user is trying to do.

2. Context: The user indicates what he tried implementing, and why (it works in MySQL).

3. Question: The questions is clearly stated: "What is the syntax to insert multiple rows at a time in an SQLite database?"


#### The Bad ####

1. The user does not say specifically what error he received when implementing the code shown.
