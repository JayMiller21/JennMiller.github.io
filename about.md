Iâ€™m a full-stack web developer who appreciates continual opportunities to learn, create, and innovate. Previously, I worked on optimizing the energy performance of new and existing buildings. There, I learned to keenly identify opportunities for improvement, taking into account a variety of constraints - A mindset that has served me well in my programming career.
